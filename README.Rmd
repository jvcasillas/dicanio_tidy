(a) Convert the columns val_F0 and val_int into long format. 
Right now, there are 9 values across each interval (numbered 1-9) and 
create a column "Time", numbered 1-9.

(b) After this, I make sure all Ã˜ and "0" are NA.

(c) Then, I create a column log(F0) and read the data into R to run my 
R code to do by-speaker F0 normalization/standardization.

(d) I often need to recode the data to extract a column containing tonal 
information. I might do this by copying over the Segment column into a 
Tonal column and then deleting all non-numerical values. I kind of like 
using existing annotations to create new ones.
